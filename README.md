## Summary
* With a rising senior population and low birth rate, we are observing more seniors living alone
* Many problems come with aging such as forgetfulness and challenges with technologies
* Through a survey, we gained an insight of difficulties seniors living alone face daily and the possibility for utilizing speech recognition technology
* Proposed solution via Alexa, Amazonâ€™s Intelligent Personal Assistant

## Issues Faced Today

* **Aging population** in the United States (11% in 1985, 13% in 2010, projected to increase to 21.7% in 2040).

  * 30% of the 40 million seniors live alone
